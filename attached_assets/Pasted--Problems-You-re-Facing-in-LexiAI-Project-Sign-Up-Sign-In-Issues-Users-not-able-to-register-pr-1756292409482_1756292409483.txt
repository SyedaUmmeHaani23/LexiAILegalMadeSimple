ðŸŸ¢ Solutions for Each Problem

Sign-Up / Sign-In

Use JWT or session-based authentication.

Hash passwords with bcrypt before saving to DB.

Validate input fields (email format, strong password).

Redirect properly after login success/failure.

File Uploading

Allow specific formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt).

Set a file size limit and show error if exceeded.

Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase, or Replit DB for small files).

Add progress bar/loading message for UX.

File Analyzing

Use libraries like pdfminer, docx2txt, or pytesseract (for images).

Optimize backend so large files are handled in chunks.

Run analysis in background worker (Celery/RQ) for better performance.

Return clean JSON response for frontend integration.

Chatbot

Use a state management system to maintain context (e.g., storing chat history).

Connect chatbot to an AI API (like OpenAI/GPT) with proper error handling.

Show typing indicator/loading while waiting for response.

Store conversations in DB for continuity.

UI/UX

Use TailwindCSS or Material UI for consistency.

Bright but readable color palette.

Add spinner/loading bar for long processes.

Keep navigation simple (Dashboard â†’ Upload â†’ Analyze â†’ Chat).

Authentication & Security

Use HTTPS (if deploying publicly).

Never store plain text passwords.

Implement Logout to clear tokens/sessions.

Keep API keys in .env files, not hardcoded.

Deployment

Use environment variables for secrets.

For free hosting: use Vercel (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend).

Set up CORS properly for frontend â†” backend communication.

Test all features (upload, analyze, chatbot) after deployment.
