The error Upload Failed: File upload failed. Please try uploading the document again. usually happens because of backend misconfiguration or file handling issues. Let’s debug step by step:

🔎 Common Reasons & Fixes
1. Backend not accepting file

Your frontend is likely sending the file, but the backend isn’t processing it.

If using Express.js, you must have multer (for file uploads).

Example:

import express from "express";
import multer from "multer";

const app = express();
const upload = multer({ dest: "uploads/" }); // saves file in uploads folder

app.post("/upload", upload.single("file"), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "No file uploaded" });
  }
  res.json({ message: "File uploaded successfully", file: req.file });
});


⚠️ If this route is missing or not linked → upload will always fail.

2. Frontend not sending file properly

When uploading, ensure you’re sending as FormData:

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", selectedFile);

fetch("http://localhost:5000/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(err => console.error(err));


If instead you try to JSON.stringify the file → ❌ it will fail.

3. CORS issue

If your frontend (Vercel/Netlify) and backend (Replit/Render/etc.) are on different domains, you must enable CORS.

Example in Express:

import cors from "cors";
app.use(cors());

4. File size limit

By default, some servers block large files (>1MB).
Set higher file size limit:

const upload = multer({
  limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 } // 10MB
});

5. Storage location issue

If deployed on Vercel → direct file storage won’t work (Vercel is serverless, no permanent disk).
✅ Solution: Use cloud storage (Firebase Storage, AWS S3, or Supabase).
Workflow:

Frontend uploads → Cloud storage (S3/Firebase).

Cloud storage → returns file URL.

Send URL → backend → analyze file with AI.

⚡ Recommended Fix for Your Case

Since you’re building AI Legal Doc Analyzer, the best approach:

Upload file → Firebase Storage / S3.

Get file URL.

Backend extracts text (pdf-parse, mammoth, etc.).

Send text to OpenAI for analysis.
