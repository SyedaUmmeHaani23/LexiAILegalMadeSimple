🔹 Brief about your solution

Our solution is a Generative AI-powered Legal Companion that simplifies complex legal documents into clear, accessible, and actionable guidance for everyday users. The platform enables individuals to upload legal documents such as contracts, agreements, and policies, which are then analyzed clause by clause. The system produces plain-language summaries, highlights critical obligations, risks, and penalties, and provides actionable next steps for users to make informed decisions.

Unlike existing tools built primarily for lawyers and enterprises, our solution is designed for citizens, small businesses, and NGOs who struggle with legal jargon and cannot afford professional consultations for every document. The platform also supports multilingual explanations, allowing users in India to access simplified legal information in their preferred language. To ensure trust and transparency, the AI provides context along with cited references to the original text, while maintaining strict data privacy and security standards for sensitive documents.

This solution not only empowers individuals to better understand their rights and responsibilities but also promotes greater access to justice, financial protection, and inclusivity across diverse communities.
