🔴 Problems in LexiAI Project

Authentication (Sign in / Sign up) not working properly

Users can’t register or log in.

Sessions aren’t being maintained.

File Upload Issues

When you upload a document (PDF, DOCX, TXT), it doesn’t process correctly.

The analysis shows same dummy text for every file.

Analysis Feature Broken

AI isn’t reading the actual uploaded document.

Shows fixed/dummy response instead of real insights.

Download Not Working

After analyzing, the PDF download button does not download the report.

Button Actions Not Responding

“Check AI Assistant with this Analysis” button is not clickable / no functionality linked.

Multilingual Support Missing

Even though you tried, it only works in English.

Non-English documents (Hindi, Kannada, Urdu, etc.) aren’t being processed properly.

UI/UX Flow Broken

No proper user feedback (e.g., “file uploaded successfully”, “analysis in progress”).

Buttons look active but don’t trigger backend functions.

🟢 Solutions for Each Problem
1. Fix Authentication

Use a proper Auth system (Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth).

Store users in DB with email + password.

Maintain session with JWT tokens.

2. Fix File Upload

Use a proper file storage system (Cloudinary, Supabase storage, or local uploads/).

Backend should parse PDF/DOCX using libraries like:

PyPDF2 or pdfplumber → for PDF

docx → for Word files

langchain.document_loaders (for multi-format support).

3. Real Analysis Instead of Dummy Text

Connect uploaded file → extract text → send to LLM API (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).

Example: analyze_document(text, language) and return structured insights.

4. Fix PDF Download

After analysis → generate PDF report using reportlab or pdfkit.

Provide proper download endpoint → frontend fetches and triggers download.

5. Fix Button Actions

Ensure frontend button → triggers API call → backend returns response.

Add onClick event with API integration.

6. Multilingual Support

Use translation API (Google Translate API, DeepL API, or OpenAI translation prompt).

Detect document language automatically → process → return analysis in that language.

Add language selector in UI.

7. Improve UI/UX Flow

Add progress indicators (e.g., “Uploading…”, “Analyzing… please wait”).

Show error messages if upload/analysis fails.

Make buttons disabled until action is possible.
