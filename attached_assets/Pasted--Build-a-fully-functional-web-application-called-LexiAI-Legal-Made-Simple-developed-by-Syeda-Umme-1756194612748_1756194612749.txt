"Build a fully functional web application called LexiAI – Legal Made Simple, developed by Syeda Umme Haani. The app should simplify legal documents using AI and provide an intuitive, professional interface. It should be production-ready with a clean codebase, authentication system, chatbot, and full MVP + core features. Use Next.js (React + Tailwind CSS) for frontend, Node.js with Express for backend, and MongoDB or PostgreSQL as the database.

🔹 Features to Implement

JWT-based authentication.

User Dashboard (After Login):

Upload legal documents (PDF/Word).

Document history for logged-in users.

AI-generated simplified summaries.

Color-coded highlights:
