Upload Legal Documents (PDF, DOCX, Images, Scanned Docs)

Extract text from PDFs and Word files.

If the document is scanned or contains images, use OCR (Tesseract) to extract text.

Process and summarize legal content using a Generative AI model.

Provide simplified explanations of clauses, obligations, risks, and summaries.

Multilingual Support (40+ Languages)

Use i18next (or any internationalization library) to handle dynamic translation of the full interface.

All UI (buttons, text, menus) and all AI-generated responses should switch automatically when a user selects a language.
